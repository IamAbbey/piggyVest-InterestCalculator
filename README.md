## Getting Started


Fixed Deposits have been the most popular choice of investment in the saving community over the past years. It has become this way due to the low-risk yet high reward characteristics of the saving plan. It is a kind of term deposit that helps you earn much higher interest than regular savings accounts. Piggyvest have fixed interest rates that stay consistent throughout the tenure until the maturity period closes. Our saving plan that emulates this form of savings is what we call SafeLock. 
SafeLock is a fixed savings option that allows you to earn up to 15.5% per annum, usually paid up front.
Your Safelock acts as your sub-account so that you can transfer and lock funds from your Piggybank wallet or your debit card for at least 10 days, without access to these funds until maturity.
The SafeLock feature is one step further towards curbing the temptation to touch money that you have put aside as your savings

To reap the maximum benefits from your SafeLock, you have to understand just how it works and how the interest rates are calculated, but before we get to that. You will need to know all there is to know.

How does SafeLock?

SafeLock interests are prorated and paid for the duration you set. 
On funds locked for:
o	10-30 days, the interest is calculated at 6% per annum and prorated for the duration you set.
o	31-60 days, the interest is calculated at 8% per annum and prorated accordingly
o	61-90 days, the interest is calculated at 10% per annum and prorated accordingly
o	91 days- 2 years, the interest is calculated at 13% per annum and prorated accordingly.   
o	2 years and above, the interest is calculated at 15.5% per annum and prorated accordingly. 
The minimum amount that may be kept in SafeLock is N1000.

So, if you opt for a six-month term which falls between 91 days – 2 years, you’ll enjoy an interest rate of 13% at the end of the term.

SafeLock Interest calculator

The SafeLock Interest calculator is a mobile calculator that investors can use to calculate their returns, mainly regarding maturity benefits. You can input your basic details, such as your preferred lock amount, start date and the time period, to calculate your returns once the deposit has matured.

Interest rates vary based on duration. Usually, a longer maturity period will yield more returns. The interest is on annual on all duration chosen.

How is the SafeLock Interest calculated?

The maturity value and interest earned from SafeLock is calculated with a simple formula.

A = P x (1 + r)t
I = A – P
Here,
A= maturity value
P= Principal amount
r= rate of interest
t= tenure ( number of days)
I= Amount of interest to be earned
Example
If you lock an amount of N20000 in your SafeLock three years at an annual interest rate of 15.5% then,
Principal amount = N20,000
Rate of interest = 15.5%= 0.155
Tenure= 3 years
Solution
A = P x (1 + r)t
= 20000 x (1+0.155/3)
= 20000x (1+ 0.05167)
=20000x (1. 05167)
Maturity Value (A) = N23152.5
I = A-P
N23152.5 – N20000

I = N3152.5
